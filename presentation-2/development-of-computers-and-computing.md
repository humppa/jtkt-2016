# Development of Computers and Computing

## Computer

A device<sup>(*</sup> that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of
arithmetic or logical operations automatically.

## Computing

Any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefitting from, or creating an algorithm.

<!---
*) Computer applies to humans too â€“ not just machines.

Computer to computer definition changed from 1920 to 1940.

Computing has many competing definitions.

<!---
Punched cards controlled Joseph Marie Jacquard's loom in 1801, where a hole
punched in the card indicated a binary one and an unpunched spot indicated a
binary zero. Jacquard's loom was far from being a computer, but it did
illustrate that machines could be driven by binary systems.

Semen Korsakov was reputedly the first to use the punched cards in informatics
for information store and search (in 1832).
